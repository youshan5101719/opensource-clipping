## [v1.7.2] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Asynchronous Fetching**: Fetching playlists is now done asynchronously in the background. The user interface remains responsive and displays a real-time progress bar to track the fetching process.
- **Channel Avatars**: YouTube channel profile pictures are automatically fetched in the background and rendered natively in the UI.

## [v1.7.1] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Dedicated Navigation**: Added standalone pages for Playlists (`#/playlists`) and Manual Videos (`#/manual`) with static sidebar links for direct access, decluttering the dashboard view.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Added validation when adding manual videos. If a video is already in the database, a warning popup is shown and no data is modified.

## [v1.7.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added (YouTube Tracker)
- **Bulk Status Updates**: Added "Select All" and checkbox selection for videos in Duplicates, Source Detail, Channel Detail, and Search pages to mark multiple videos as Used, Candidate, Unused, or Skipped at once.
- **Quick Actions**: Added a quick "✓ Used" button on video rows to mark them instantly without opening the edit modal.
- **Improved Dashboard UI**: Split the "Add Playlist" and "Add Manual Video" forms into always-visible side-by-side cards.
- **Large Playlist Support**: Fixed an issue where playlists with >100 videos were being truncated. Added robust 3x retry logic with exponential backoff for fetching metadata.
- **Channel Avatars**: YouTube channel profile pictures now display on the Channels grid and inside the Channel Detail page headers.


---

## [v1.6.4] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- **Split Mode Subtitles**: Updated subtitle rendering logic to automatically center text vertically when using the `split` ratio. Standard margin and alignment configurations are perfectly preserved and restored for other aspect ratios like `9:16` and `16:9`.

---

## [v1.6.3] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **FFmpeg Crash in BGM Ducking**: Fixed a critical filtergraph crash during the BGM rendering phase (mode `ducking`). Previously, the vocal audio stream was improperly connected to two different filters (`sidechaincompress` and `amix`) simultaneously without using `asplit`, causing immediate FFmpeg failure. Also removed deprecated parameters (`dropout_transition`) from `amix` to ensure compatibility across all newer FFmpeg versions (v6.0+).

---

## [v1.6.2] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **BGM Mixing Mode (`--bgm-mode`)**: New CLI flag to choose between two BGM mixing strategies:
  - `ducking` *(default)*: Sidechain compress — BGM volume automatically lowers when speech is detected, then returns to normal during silence.
  - `background`: Constant low-volume mix — BGM plays at a steady volume throughout the clip without any dynamic adjustment.
- **Centralized Filter Builder**: Extracted all FFmpeg audio filter logic into `build_bgm_filter()` in `audio_bgm.py`, eliminating duplicated filter strings across `core.py`.

### Changed
- **`audio_bgm.py` Cleanup**: Removed ~20 unused imports (`cv2`, `mediapipe`, `numpy`, `requests`, `PIL`, `yt_dlp`, etc.) that were leftover from the original Pixabay scraping code. The module now only imports `os` and `random`.

---

## [v1.6.1] - 2026-06-19

### Changed
- **Local BGM Asset Pool**: Refactored the Auto-BGM & Ducking feature to read MP3 files from a local directory (`assets/bgm/`) instead of relying on fragile web scraping from Pixabay. This resolves stability issues, rate-limiting, and failed downloads during the rendering pipeline. The system now randomly selects an MP3 based on the AI's requested mood (e.g., `chill`, `epic`, `sad`). It will automatically fallback to rendering without BGM if the local asset pool is empty.

---

## [v1.6.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Web GUI Studio**: Built a complete, responsive React/Vite dashboard to replace the CLI-only workflow. Features real-time job monitoring, rich configuration forms, visual progress tracking, and an integrated media gallery for downloading clips.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Built a robust, asynchronous REST API (`web/api/app.py`) with an in-memory job queue and persistent JSON storage (`outputs/jobs.json`) to handle concurrent clip generation without blocking.
- **Real-Time Progress Streaming**: Integrated Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream live pipeline logs and progress percentages directly to the browser dashboard.
- **Docker Deployment**: Fully containerized the application with a multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`, enabling one-click deployment of the entire backend, frontend, and rendering stack in an isolated environment.
- **API Key Management UI**: Added a settings page to configure Gemini, Pexels, HuggingFace, and NVIDIA API keys dynamically without manually editing `.env` files.

---

## [v1.5.4] - 2026-05-22

### Changed
- **Hook V2 Trailing Flash**: Added a flash/glitch transition after the **last** hook item, right before the main clip starts. Previously transitions only appeared between items — now the intro ends with a clean flash that separates the hook from the main content.

---

## [v1.5.3] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- **Hook V2 Text Overlay Removed**: Removed the `drawtext` text overlay from Hook V2 micro-hook clips. The intro clips now render as clean video-only with face-tracking crop and no burned-in text.

---

## [v1.5.2] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Hook V2 Independent of `--no-hook`**: Fixed a critical issue where `--no-hook` was also disabling Hook V2. Now `--no-hook` only disables the old V1 teaser hook (3-second glitch intro), while `--hook-v2` works independently regardless of the `--no-hook` flag.
- **Hook V2 Missing from Final Output**: Fixed the final concat step which was discarding the rendered Hook V2 `.ts` file when `--no-hook` was active. The concat logic now has three distinct paths: Hook V2 (direct concat, no v1 glitch needed), Hook V1 (with glitch transition), and no hook.

---

## [v1.5.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Hook V2 Propagation Bug**: Fixed an issue where the multi-hook intro was only being rendered for the first clip (Rank 1). The pipeline now correctly applies the hook to all clips when the `--hook-v2` flag is provided, and auto-generates fallback hooks using timing division if the AI fails to return the `items` array.
- **Hook V2 Transition Rendering**: Fixed a silent FFmpeg failure when concatenating hook clips with transitions. MP4 transition files generated by `v2_helpers` are now correctly converted to `.ts` using `-c copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb` to prevent hardware encoder crashes during stream remuxing.

---

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Multi-Hook Intro V2 (`--hook-v2`)**: New dynamic multi-clip intro generator. AI picks 3-4 of the most punchy/controversial micro-moments from the clip, renders them as rapid-fire 0.5-2 second hooks, and stitches them together with customizable flash or glitch transitions. Configurable via `--hook-v2-items`, `--hook-v2-style`, and `--white-flash-duration`.
- **Segment-Based Clip Trimming**: AI now analyzes each clip for boring, silent, or filler sections and returns `keep_segments` — only the best parts are rendered and concatenated. This dramatically improves pacing, especially for long-form clips with dead air.
  - BGM ducking is applied after segment concatenation to ensure seamless audio across cuts.
  - Disable with `--no-segment-trim` to render full start-to-end as before.
  - Use `--silence-trim` to instruct AI to aggressively remove all pauses >0.5s.
- **V2 Transition Helpers**: New `clipping/studio/v2_helpers.py` module that generates white-flash and RGB-glitch transition clips using FFmpeg `lavfi` filters.
- **New CLI Flags**: `--hook-v2`, `--hook-v2-items`, `--hook-v2-style`, `--white-flash-duration`, `--no-segment-trim`, `--silence-trim`.

---

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Story Clip Mode (`--story-mode`)**: Brand-new multi-source narrative assembly pipeline for building clips from multiple video sources. Designed for campaign work (e.g., Shopee, brand briefs) where specific scenes from different videos must be stitched together into a cohesive story.
  - Define video sources in `sources.json` — supports YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Google Drive, and local files.
  - Define the clip recipe in `story_recipe.json` — specify scenes with exact timestamps, hooks, highlights, transitions, and metadata per clip.
  - Each clip produces **2 separate outputs**: `hook_N.mp4` (teaser intro) and `highlight_N.mp4` (main content).
  - Automatic multi-source download with idempotent caching (`outputs/story_cache/`).
  - Scene normalization ensures consistent resolution/fps across heterogeneous sources before concatenation.
  - Transition support: `cut` (hard cut) and `smooth`/`crossfade` (0.5s dissolve).
  - Hook text overlay rendering via FFmpeg drawtext filter.
  - Full manifest output (`story_manifest.json`) with status tracking per clip.
  - Includes `sources.sample.json` and `story_recipe.sample.json` templates.
- **New CLI Flags**:
  - `--story-mode`: Enable Story Clip pipeline (bypasses AI analysis — no `GOOGLE_API_KEY` needed).
  - `--story-recipe`: Path to recipe JSON (default: `story_recipe.json`).
  - `--sources-json`: Path to sources registry JSON (default: `sources.json`).
  - `--story-output-dir`: Custom output directory (default: `outputs/story_clips`).
  - `--skip-download`: Skip source downloads and use existing cache.
- **New Modules**:
  - `clipping/story/loader.py` — JSON parser & validator with cross-reference validation between sources and recipe.
  - `clipping/story/source_manager.py` — Multi-platform download & cache manager (reuses existing engine).
  - `clipping/story/assembler.py` — FFmpeg-based scene trimming, normalization, concatenation, and text overlay.
  - `clipping/story_runner.py` — Pipeline orchestrator for Story Clip mode.

### Changed
- **`--url` is now optional**: The `--url` flag is no longer globally required — it is only required when running in standard auto-clip mode. Story Clip mode uses `sources.json` instead.

---

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Multi-Platform Source Support**: Refactored the source engine to support multiple video platforms natively via the new `--source` CLI flag. You can now download videos directly from `youtube` (default), `tiktok`, `instagram`, and `gdrive`.
  - When a non-YouTube platform is selected, the download engine uses a simplified `yt-dlp` format selector optimized for their single-quality serving.
  - YouTube subtitle fallback (`--use-dlp-subs`) is automatically skipped for non-YouTube sources — Whisper is always used for transcription.
- **Source Platform Banner**: The startup banner now displays the active source platform for clarity.

### Fixed
- **HEVC PyAV Crash (TikTok)**: Fixed an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` crash during Whisper transcription. `yt-dlp` was occasionally fetching TikTok videos encoded in highly compressed H.265 (`bytevc1`), which caused PyAV's container demuxer to fail in environments like Kaggle and Colab. The non-YouTube download selector has been explicitly tuned (`bestvideo[vcodec^=h264]`) to prefer H.264 codecs, ensuring flawless audio extraction and maximum compatibility.
- **Google Drive Download (429 Rate-Limit)**: Replaced `yt-dlp`'s unreliable Google Drive extractor with a dedicated `gdown`-based downloader. `gdown` handles Google Drive authentication and cookie management far more reliably, resolving `HTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests` failures in Kaggle/Colab environments.
- **Post-Download Verification**: Added file existence checks after every download. If the video file is not found (e.g. due to rate-limiting, invalid URLs, or network issues), the pipeline now raises a clear error immediately instead of proceeding to Whisper transcription on a missing file.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Restored `--tiktok` as a deprecated CLI flag alias that maps directly to `--source tiktok` to prevent existing automated scripts and Colab notebooks from breaking.

---

## [v1.2.3] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **Dynamic Aspect Ratio for Split-Screen & Camera Switch**: Fixed a bug where both Split-Screen (`MODE_SPLIT=True`) and Camera Switch rendering engines would statically force a `9:16` output regardless of the user's `--ratio` configuration. These modes now correctly support dynamic canvas bounds and arithmetic for arbitrary aspect ratios (such as `1:1`, `3:4`, and `4:5`) as intended.

---

## [v1.2.2] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Static Center Crop**: Added `--static-crop` flag to disable face tracking for `1:1`, `3:4`, and `4:5` output ratios. When active, the system bypasses AI detection and performs a direct, static center-crop, dramatically speeding up the rendering pipeline for formats that don't strictly require face-tracking.

---

## [v1.2.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Viral-Bility Scoring**: Added `viral_score` (1-100) to the AI analysis engine. The system now evaluates each clip's viral potential based on hook strength, emotional impact, and retention markers.
- **Viral-First Ranking**: Updated the pipeline to automatically sort generated clips by their `viral_score` in descending order, sequentially re-assigning ranks 1-N based on viral potential.
- **Integrated Account Classification**: Added a specialized classification layer to the metadata prompt. AI now automatically assigns each clip to a target account (Business, Life, Creator, or Muslim) based on its specific "angle" and content niche.
- **Modular Account Config**: Extracted target account definitions into a centralized `TARGET_ACCOUNTS` variable in `engine.py`. This allows for easy customization of account names, bios, and classification rules without modifying the core prompt text.
- **Visual B-Roll Hook Recommendations**: Added `recommended_visual_broll_hook` to AI-generated clip metadata. It provides 2-5 opening visual hook ideas (0-3 seconds) with search keywords and rationale, acting as a creative reference for manual B-roll hunting.
- **Enhanced Metadata Preview**: Expanded the CLI metadata preview to display the new `viral_score`, Target Account destination, and the AI's classification rationale.

---

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Multi-Ratio Output Support**: Added three new output aspect ratios — `1:1` (Square), `3:4` (Instagram Portrait), and `4:5` (Facebook/Instagram Feed). All three use the same face-tracking crop behavior as `9:16`, automatically detecting and following faces within the narrower frame.
  - CLI usage: `--ratio 1:1`, `--ratio 3:4`, `--ratio 4:5`
  - Split-screen, camera-switch, B-roll, subtitles, glitch transitions, and dev-mode all fully support the new ratios.

### Fixed
- **16:9 Letterbox (No Stretch)**: When the source video's aspect ratio doesn't match the 16:9 output (e.g., a 9:16 or 1:1 source rendered to 16:9), the system now applies proper **letterboxing** (black bars) to preserve the original proportions instead of stretching the image to fill the frame.

---

## [v1.1.2] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Glitch Effect NameError**: Fixed a `NameError: name '_get_render_dims' is not defined` in `clipping/studio/effects.py`. Restored the missing import that was lost during the code extraction phase of the studio modularization.

---

## [v1.1.1] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Studio Orchestrator NameError**: Fixed a `NameError: name '_load_studio_internal_module' is not defined` in `clipping/studio/core.py`. Added the missing internal module loader definition to ensure the main orchestrator can correctly resolve and load specialized sub-modules at runtime.

---

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- **Core Engine Modularization**: Completed the second phase of the Studio architecture refactoring. The massive 3700-line `clipping/studio/core.py` file has been cleanly split into 11 specialized sub-modules (e.g., `face_detection.py`, `typography.py`, `render_hybrid.py`, `subtitles.py`).
- **Preserved Public API**: `core.py` was converted into a pure orchestrator that dynamically imports these sub-modules. The execution flow, business logic, FFMPEG operations, and public interfaces remain 100% untouched to guarantee perfect backward compatibility.
- **Enhanced Code Documentation**: Added comprehensive docstrings to all major functions across the newly created internal modules, detailing their arguments, return values, and side effects.

---

## [v1.0.7] - 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- **Dynamic Split Dev Visibility**: Fixed the developer UI in `--split-screen` with `--dynamic-split` enabled. Previously, the inactive "ghost" horizontal Split-screen boundary lines were permanently drawn over the feed even when the system dynamically transitioned into a full single-speaker 9:16 layout. The rendering logic now exclusively toggles and draws only the layout boundaries that are currently active, ensuring a perfectly clean display.

---

## [v1.0.6] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Standard Mode Output Logger Crash**: Fixed a critical bug in standard Hybrid layout where rendering aborted halfway via an `UnboundLocalError`. The progress logger attempted to use the `format_seconds` time helper, which was accidentally isolated only within the `--dev-mode` scope during recent refactoring. The helper has been globally elevated safely.

---

## [v1.0.5] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **UnboundLocalError Crash**: Fixed a crash inside the newly upgraded Hybrid `dev-mode` (`cannot access local variable 'math' where it is not associated with a value`) caused by an improper inline `import` scope. This logic has been rewritten to native python integers.

---

## [v1.0.4] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Hybrid Merge Output Dev UI**: The basic Hybrid 9:16 layout now fully supports the sophisticated side-by-side `--dev-mode-with-output-merge` developer user interface. It draws the `DIRECTOR'S CONSOLE (Raw 16:9)` alongside the `FINAL OUTPUT (Crop 9:16)` with the dynamic neon green HUD text (tracking layout status and timestamps), achieving full visual parity with the podcast Split-Screen debugging view!

---

## [v1.0.3] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Dev-Mode Hybrid Visuals Crash**: Fixed another leftover reference bug (`name 'get_box' is not defined`) in standard 9:16 mode rendering when Developer Visualization mode (`--dev-mode`) is enabled. Added the missing box-retrieval function to the hybrid engine.
- **Dev-Mode Aim Lines Geometry**: Fixed a visual bug in standard Hybrid Dev Mode where the yellow tracking crosshairs ("aim lines") extending from the face bounding box scaled incorrectly, causing them to shoot past the right boundary and invert inwardly on the left boundary. They now perfectly anchor themselves strictly from the face's bounding box edges to the outer edges of the 9:16 focus window.

---

## [v1.0.2] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Standard Layout Crash**: Fixed a `NameError: name 'default_x' is not defined` crash that affected the basic Hybrid 9:16 layout rendering (`--no-split-screen`). This was an obsolete variable left over from the coordinate mapping refactor. Standard mode rendering is now fully operational again.

---

## [v1.0.1] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Standard Layout Parity**: The standard 9:16 render mode (used when Split-Screen is disabled) has been internally updated to use the exact same responsive `camera snap threshold` and `median startup logic` as the advanced Split-Screen tracking engine. This guarantees perfectly centered teleportation across scene-cuts regardless of rendering mode.

---

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **🎉 MAJOR STABLE RELEASE**: The 1.0.0 release graduates the `opensource-clipping` pipeline into a fully production-ready state! It finalizes all major milestone features including the multi-provider AI backend, High-Resolution renders, and the highly robust Dynamic Split-Screen / Camera-Tracking engines.

---

## [v0.9.18] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Phantom Interpolation Gap**: Resolved a major camera tracking bug in Visual-Only mode (`--split-trigger face`) where tight-shots (1 face) were randomly assigned to a single logical speaker stream, causing the fallback layout camera to perceive a "tracking gap". It now perfectly replicates single tight-shot coordinates to both logical tracking streams, completely eliminating the "panning early prior to a scene cut" visual glitch in Full Layout mode.

---

## [v0.9.17] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Zero-Delay Scene Cut Detection**: Overhauled the `split→full` and `full→split` layout transition logic in Visual-Only mode (`--split-trigger face`). Transitions now instantly trigger on camera cuts (0 seconds delay), eliminating ghosting and layout lag.
- **Dynamic Tracking Deadzone**: Re-engineered the camera deadzone scale to strictly follow the 9:16 vertical crop width, adapting dynamically to the split zoom level. This dramatically increases tracking responsiveness and prevents faces from remaining stuck near the frame edges in both Full and Split modes.

---

## [v0.9.16] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Instant Smart Framing**: Refined the initial state for split-screen and camera-switch modes. Camera zoom now snaps to the optimal separation level on the first frame, eliminating the gradual "zoom-in" effect at the start of clips.
- **Aggressive Face Separation**: Increased the auto-zoom safety margin and added a head-width buffer. This ensures neighboring faces are completely cropped out of frame for a professional, distraction-free view.
- **Dynamic Glitch Scaling**: Transition videos (glitch) now dynamically scale to match the specific resolution of each output stream (Standard, Dev Mode, or Merged Dashboard).
- **Solo Vertical Tracking**: Standardized `buat_video_hybrid` to support full center-point tracking and vertical centering, matching the quality of the podcast pipelines.

### Changed
- **Unified Tracking API**: Standardized internal helper functions to return absolute center coordinates. This simplifies and stabilizes coordinate math for subtitle generation and AI visualization.

### Fixed
- **NameError 'ref_crop_w'**: Resolved a critical runtime error in the smoothing logic where a variable reference was missing.

---

## [v0.9.15] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Smart Separation Auto-Zoom**: Implemented dynamic zoom for split-screen and camera-switch modes. The system now adjusts individual panel zoom levels based on neighboring face proximity to ensure the main subject remains isolated and centered, even in crowded podcast shots.
- **Dynamic Vertical Tracking**: Added vertical alignment support across all podcast rendering pipelines. The camera now tracks both X and Y coordinates with configurable biasing via `--split-v-align`.
- **Exposed Split Controls**: Added manual controls for split-screen optimization including `--split-zoom`, `--split-v-align`, `--split-auto-zoom`, and `--split-max-zoom`.

### Fixed
- **Standardized Face Tracking Data**: Overhauled the internal tracking dictionary structure to use absolute center coordinates (`cx`, `cy`) and distance metrics (`dist`) consistently. This definitively resolves the `KeyError` bugs encountered during rapid layout transitions.
- **Robust Auto-Zoom Smoothing**: Integrated independent zoom smoothing for each panel, preventing "vignetting" or sudden jumps in framing during chaotic multi-person scenes.

---

## [v0.9.6] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Instant Split→Full Transition**: Eliminated the visible "ghost frame" where the split-screen layout persisted for a fraction of a second showing only 1 person in a 2-panel view before switching to full 9:16 crop. The `split→full` transition now fires on the same frame the face count drops to 1, bypassing both the majority-vote window and `MIN_HOLD` timer. The reverse direction (`full→split`) remains guarded to prevent flicker.

---

## [v0.9.8] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Configurable Source Download Quality**: Added `--source-height` CLI flag to control preferred source resolution at download time (e.g. `1080`, `1440`, `2160`).

### Changed
- **Default Source Strategy**: If `--source-height` is not provided, downloader now prefers the highest available source quality (`max`) to preserve sharpness after 16:9 → 9:16 crop.

---

## [v0.9.13] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Multi-Cloud AI Providers**: Integrated NVIDIA NIM API support (DeepSeek-V3/V4, Llama-3, etc) as an alternative to Gemini.
- **Guided JSON Generation**: Implemented strict JSON schema enforcement for NVIDIA models to guarantee 100% output accuracy.
- **AI-Agnostic Metadata Validator**: Added intelligent field aliasing (e.g., mapping 'peringkat' to 'rank') and auto-flattening for cross-model stability.
- **Failover Logic**: Automated failover from NVIDIA to Gemini if the provider is unavailable.

---

## [v0.9.12] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Auto-Bitrate Management**: Implemented resolution-aware bitrate selection (4M/8M/12M/20M) to optimize files for TikTok/Reels algorithms.
- **Subtle Sharpening Filter**: Added `--video-sharpen` flag to enhance clarity and texture detail in final renders.
- **NVENC Quality Tuning**: Switched to VBR (Variable Bitrate) mode with peak rate headroom for better motion handling.

---

## [v0.9.11] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Glitch Transition Resolution Bug**: Fixed an issue where the glitch teaser disappeared when using high-resolution rendering (2K/4K). The glitch video is now dynamically scaled to match the main video's output dimensions before concatenation.

---

## [v0.9.10] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Dynamic Render Resolution**: Added `--render-height` flag to allow custom output heights (e.g. `1080`, `1440`, `2160`, or `source`).
- **Smart Result Scaling**: Subtitles, layouts, and tracking windows now scale proportionally when rendering at high resolutions (2K/4K).
- **Download Verification**: Added real-time logging of the actual resolution and codec selected by `yt-dlp` to ensure quality targets are met.

### Fixed
- **AV1 Codec Incompatibility**: Explicitly excluded AV1 codec (`av01`) from download selection to prevent rendering crashes on platforms without hardware AV1 decoding (e.g., Colab T4). Prioritizes VP9 for high-res assets.

---

## [v0.9.9] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Video Quality Tuning Flags**: Added `--video-cq`, `--video-crf`, `--video-preset`, and `--video-scale-algo` for sharper output tuning on both normal and `--dynamic-split` rendering paths.

### Changed
- **Encoder Selection Integration**: `detect_video_encoder()` now respects runtime config tuning values while preserving backward-compatible defaults when flags are not provided.
- **Render Scaling Quality**: OpenCV resize operations in Studio rendering now use configurable interpolation (default `lanczos`) to preserve more detail after 16:9 → 9:16 crops.

---

## [v0.9.7] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- **Studio Modularization (Non-Breaking)**: Refactored the monolithic `clipping/studio.py` into smaller internal modules under `clipping/studio/` (`core.py`, `helpers.py`, `ffmpeg_utils.py`) while keeping `clipping/studio.py` as the thin primary compatibility entry point.
- **Code Organization**: Moved internal rendering, subtitle, asset handling, and FFmpeg helper implementations into cohesive modules without changing CLI parameters, pipeline order, output naming, or public function contracts used by `runner.py`.

### Documentation
- **Docstring Coverage**: Added/expanded docstrings on public and non-trivial internal Studio functions to improve maintainability and onboarding without changing runtime behavior.

---

## [v0.9.5] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Manual Custom Hook Override**: Added `--hook-source` flag to use a specific external video file (.mp4) as the teaser hook for all generated clips.
- **Hook Tailoring**: Added `--hook-source-start` to define the exact starting point within the custom hook video.
- **Clean B-Roll Style**: Custom hooks now automatically skip subtitle rendering to preserve the original visual quality (ideal for quotes or cinematic assets).

---

## [v0.9.4] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Gemini JSON Caching**: The engine now automatically saves the raw Gemini AI analysis to `gemini_response.json` in the output directory.
- **Reproducibility Flag**: Added `--load-gemini-json` CLI argument to bypass AI generation and load results from a local file, enabling faster reproduction and debugging of specific clip layouts.

---

## [v0.9.3] - 2026-04-20

### Improved
- **Visual Merge Dashboard (Experimental)**: Added white bounding boxes, padded margins, and legend titles to the `--dev-mode-with-output-merge` view. 
- **Resolution Update**: Merged output resolution is now `2648x1220` to accommodate the new visual framing.
- **Note**: This enhanced styling is currently experimental. Users can revert to the standard side-by-side view from v0.9.2 if preferred.

---

## [v0.9.2] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Dual-Render Pipeline**: Added `--dev-mode-with-output` to generate both standard video and the dev dashboard simultaneously as two separate files.
- **Merged Dashboard**: Added `--dev-mode-with-output-merge` combining the standard output and the dev dashboard side-by-side into a single ultrawide video feed (2527x1080 resolution).

---

## [v0.9.1] - 2026-04-20

### Improved
- **Director's Console (Clear Window)**: Added a "spotlight" effect in Dev Mode where the active crop area is shown at 100% brightness while the background remains dimmed.
- **Dual Layout HUD**: Both Solo and Split crop boundaries are now visible simultaneously in Dev Mode, with high-contrast highlighting for the active layout.

---

## [v0.9.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Director's Console (Dev Mode)**: Implemented a professional debugging visualization for the `split-screen` / `dynamic-split` pipeline. Includes real-time HUD showing face counts, scene difference values, and layout switch hold timers.
- **Visual Stability Calibration**: Added yellow face-boxes and white crop outlines in dev-mode for precision tuning.

---

## [v0.8.9] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Instant Initial Layout**: Fixed a bug where even a solo shot would stay in split-screen for 2 seconds (default `switch-hold-duration`) at the very start of a clip. Now the system can make an instant correct layout decision at `t=0`.

---

## [v0.8.8] - 2026-04-19

### Improved
- **Enhanced Scene-Cut Sensitivity**: Lowered the visual difference threshold from 30 to 18 to better detect camera cuts in videos with dark themes/backgrounds.
- **Aggressive Face Merging**: Increased IoU overlap sensitivity to 0.2 to prevent near-face ghosting in close-up shots.

---

## [v0.8.6] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Instant Layout Reset on Scene Cuts**: Added a visual scene-cut detector that clears the layout stability history immediately when a camera cut occurs. This eliminates the "lag" where the video stayed in split-screen for ~1s after a cut to a solo shot.

---

## [v0.8.5] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Exposed Tracking Tuning Parameters**: Added new CLI flags for manual stability adjustment:
  - `--track-conf`: Confidence threshold for face detection.
  - `--track-smooth-window`: Frame window for majority-vote layout stability (includes time conversion guide in README).

---

## [v0.8.4] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Experimental Stability Filter for `--dynamic-split`**: Added three-layer protection against "ghost" split-screen triggers:
  - Higher YOLO confidence threshold (0.55).
  - IoU box merger to prevent duplicate face detections for the same person.
  - Majority-vote layout smoothing (12-frame window) to prevent flickering during dynamic transitions.

---

## [v0.8.3] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Off-Center Solo Crops**: Fixed the bug where speakers were off-center in full 9:16 solo mode within split-screen.
- **Aligned Tracking Parameters**: Split-screen tracking now uses identical default parameters (Deadzone, Smoothing, Step) as the standard hybrid mode for a consistent "feel".
- **Coordinate Overhaul**: Implemented absolute center-X tracking (`cx`) to support dynamic layout-independent centering.
- **Stability Tuning**: Improved logic to work better with `--face-detector yolo` for profile-heavy podcast scenarios.

---

## [v0.8.2] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Visual-Based Split Trigger** (`--split-trigger face`): Alternative way to decide when to split the screen.
  - Switches to Split layout when 2+ faces are detected.
  - Switches to Full layout when 1 face is detected.
  - **No HF_TOKEN required**: Can run without Speaker Diarization.
  - Highly efficient as it uses existing face tracking data.
- **Improved Resiliency**: Diarization helpers are now more robust when no speaker data is available.

---

## [v0.8.1] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Dynamic Split-Screen Mode** (`--dynamic-split`): New feature for split-screen layouts that automatically switches between full-screen and split-screen based on speaker activity. 
  - If 1 speaker is active, the system renders a full 9:16 crop on that speaker.
  - If 2+ speakers are active, the system renders the standard top-bottom split.
  - Includes a "hold duration" to prevent flickering during rapid dialogue.
- **Subtitle Tracking for Split-Screen**: Subtitles now correctly follow the speaker's face in both full and split layouts when using `--dynamic-split`.

---

## [v0.8.0] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Dev-Mode Subtitle Alignment**: Subtitles now dynamically follow the 9:16 tracking window in `--dev-mode`, ensuring they stay centered within the highlighted box rather than the full 16:9 frame.

---

## [v0.7.9] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Crosshair Tracking Lines** (`--track-lines`): New visualization feature that draws horizontal and vertical yellow lines extending from the face box to the boundaries of the 9:16 crop window. Automatically enabled in `--dev-mode`.

---

## [v0.7.8] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Dev-Mode Stability**: Fixed `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'frame_utama_siap'` that occurred in `--dev-mode` when B-roll transitions were triggered.

---

## [v0.7.7] - 2026-04-18

> ⚠️ **Experimental**: The dev-mode stabilizer visualization is currently experimental.

### Added
- **Developer Visualization Mode** (`--dev-mode`): New flag for 9:16 target ratio that renders a 16:9 context view. It visualizes the "Director's view" of the stabilization process by dimming the background outside the 9:16 crop, drawing boundary lines, and labeling tracking targets. Useful for fine-tuning AI tracking speed and deadzones.

---

## [v0.7.6] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Face Detection Visualization**: Introduced the `--box-face-detection` CLI flag. This draws a yellow bounding box around every detected face in the source frame, with smooth linear interpolation between detection intervals. Useful for debugging face tracking accuracy.

---

## [v0.7.5] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Configurable Tracking Parameters**: Exposed internal camera tracking constants as CLI flags. If not provided, the system defaults to the optimized values introduced in v0.7.4.
  - `--track-step`: Face detection frequency in seconds.
  - `--track-deadzone`: Camera deadzone ratio.
  - `--track-smooth`: Camera smoothing/catch-up factor.
  - `--track-jitter`: Micro-jitter pixel threshold.
  - `--track-snap`: Jump threshold for hard cuts between speakers.

---

## [v0.7.4] - 2026-04-18

### Improved
- **Optimized Face Tracking & Camera Responsiveness**: Fine-tuned internal camera parameters for tighter and faster centering during face tracking.
  - **Higher Detection Frequency**: Increased face check rate to every 0.25s (previously 0.5s) to reduce camera lag in dynamic scenes.
  - **Tighter Deadzone**: Reduced the safe "no-move" zone to 15% (previously 25%), ensuring the subject stays closer to the center of the frame.
  - **Responsive Catch-up**: Increased smoothing speed to 30%, making the camera follow movement more assertively while maintaining fluid motion.
  - **Micro-jitter Prevention**: Increased the jitter threshold to 5px to ensure a steady shot despite high-frequency AI detection updates.

---

## [v0.7.3] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **No-Subs Mode** (`--no-subs`): New flag to disable subtitle rendering in the final video output. The transcription process (Whisper) still runs to enable AI analysis and ranking, but the text is not burned into the video. Useful for creators who want clean B-roll or their own manual captioning later.

---

## [v0.7.2] - 2026-04-13

### Improved
- **Multi-Speaker Multi-Scene Podcast Support**: Both `--split-screen` and `--camera-switch` now handle podcast formats with **3+ speakers across multiple scenes** (e.g., 2 speakers in one camera shot + 1 speaker in a separate solo shot). Use `--diarization-speakers 3` to enable.
  - **Split-Screen**: Per-speaker frozen frame cache — each speaker now has their own fallback crop instead of a single shared one. Both panels (top & bottom) can independently fall back to their speaker's last valid frame when the speaker is not visible in the current scene.
  - **Camera-Switch**: Scene-aware simultaneous speech — when 2+ speakers talk simultaneously but are in **different scenes** (one is solo-scene type), the system stays on the current speaker instead of switching to blurred pillarbox. Wide-shot only triggers when all active speakers share the same physical frame.
  - **Hybrid Visual Auto-Detection**: Added the `auto` option (which is now the default) for `--diarization-speakers`. When set to `auto`, the system performs a rapid visual scan of 20 sampled frames to find the maximum number of people physically appearing together. This number is then injected dynamically into Pyannote as a boundary guide, optimizing accuracy and significantly reducing "over-segmentation" issues.
  - **Split-Screen**: Refactored panel rendering into a reusable `_build_panel()` helper; both panels now use identical fallback logic.

### Notes
- Backward compatible with existing 2-speaker podcast workflows — no changes needed for standard usage.
- For 3-speaker podcasts, set `--diarization-speakers 3` to let Pyannote detect all speakers correctly.

---

## [v0.7.1] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **TikTok Indonesian Metadata Support**: Added new fields `tiktok_title_id` and `tiktok_caption_id` specifically for Indonesian-localized TikTok content.
- **Enhanced Validations**: Added warnings if English fields contain Indonesian text or if Indonesian fields contain non-Indonesian text to ensure strict locale compliance.
- **Enriched Preview**: Updated `print_preview()` to display the new TikTok ID fields in the CLI output.

---

## [v0.7.0] - 2026-04-06

> ⚠️ **Experimental**: The camera-switch feature in this version is experimental and may be rolled back or undergo significant changes in future updates.

### Added
- **Camera-Switch Mode** (`--camera-switch`): New full 9:16 rendering mode for podcast-style videos. Uses Pyannote speaker diarization to detect who is speaking at each moment and automatically switches the crop to focus on the active speaker — similar to a live director cutting between camera angles.
  - **Single speaker active** → full 9:16 crop centred and face-tracked on that speaker
  - **Both speakers simultaneously** → **blurred pillarbox** (original 16:9 frame centred with blurred background filling the 9:16 canvas — no black bars)
  - **No one speaking** → holds on the last active speaker
  - **Minimum hold duration** (`--switch-hold-duration`, default `2.0` s) prevents flickering when speakers alternate rapidly
- **Blurred Pillarbox Helper** (`_make_blurred_pillarbox`): Internal renderer that produces TikTok/Reels-style blurred letterbox/pillarbox by using a scaled + Gaussian-blurred version of the source frame as background, with the original frame composited at the centre.
- **`get_active_speakers()` in `diarization.py`**: New helper that returns *all* speakers active at a given timestamp (vs. the existing `get_active_speaker()` which returns only the first). Enables detection of simultaneous speech for the blurred pillarbox transition.

### Changed
- **Diarization trigger in `runner.py`**: Speaker diarization is now also triggered when `--camera-switch` is active (previously only triggered for `--split-screen`).

### Notes
- `--camera-switch` and `--split-screen` are mutually exclusive; if both flags are passed, `--split-screen` takes precedence.
- Requires `HF_TOKEN` set in `.env` (same as split-screen).

---

## [v0.6.3] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Pyannote 3.1 Compatibility**: Fixed `'DiarizeOutput' object has no attribute 'itertracks'` by correctly extracting the `Annotation` object from the newer `DiarizeOutput` wrapper in `clipping/diarization.py`.

---

## [v0.6.2] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Diarization Robustness**: Fixed `'DiarizeOutput' object has no attribute 'itertracks'` by adding logic to handle wrapped annotation objects in newer Pyannote versions and adding debug diagnostic info.

---

## [v0.6.1] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Pyannote API Compatibility**: Fixed `Pipeline.from_pretrained() got an unexpected keyword argument 'use_auth_token'` error by updating to the newer `token` parameter, with automatic fallback to `use_auth_token` for older versions.

---

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-04-06

> ⚠️ **Experimental**: The split-screen feature in this version is experimental and may be rolled back or undergo significant changes in future updates. Use with discretion.

### Added
- **Podcast Split-Screen Mode**: Introduced `--split-screen` flag that activates automatic **Pyannote speaker diarization** to detect 2 speakers in podcast-style videos. When enabled on `9:16` ratio, the renderer produces a **top-bottom split-screen** layout where each panel independently face-tracks a different speaker. The active speaker's panel is highlighted with a yellow border while the inactive speaker's panel is subtly darkened.
- **Diarization Module**: New `clipping/diarization.py` module powered by `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` with GPU acceleration support, automatic segment merging, and active speaker lookup.
- **CLI Parameters**: Added `--split-screen` (enable split-screen mode) and `--diarization-speakers` (set expected number of speakers, default 2).
- **Graceful Fallback**: If diarization fails (missing `HF_TOKEN`, model error, or only 1 speaker detected), the system automatically falls back to the standard single-panel renderer.

### Dependencies
- Added `pyannote.audio`, `torch`, `torchaudio` to `requirements.txt`.

---

## [v0.5.3] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed / Added
- **Decoupled Subtitle Fetching**: Completely separated the video downloader from the subtitle downloader in `yt-dlp`. Subtitles are now independently grabbed utilizing `skip_download: True`. This ensures that even if YouTube blocks the subtitle request (`HTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests`), the video will still be downloaded without interruption, falling back to Whisper flawlessly.
- **Multilingual Priority Ladder**: Implemented a sequential priority loop that searches for English (`en`) subtitles first, followed by Indonesian (`id`) if unavailable. `runner.py` now supports automatic regional `.json3` mapping via glob regex matching.

---

## [v0.5.2] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **JSON3 Word-Level Slicing**: Upgraded the YouTube `json3` subtitles parsing system to intelligently split broader subtitle sentences into isolated space-separated characters while distributing original timestamps evenly. This ensures kinetic karaoke annotations emphasize authentically, precisely matching `faster-whisper`'s per-word word tracking level.

---

## [v0.5.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **JSON3 Text Sanitizer**: Implemented a regex sanitizer for YouTube auto-generated captions (`parse_youtube_json3_subs`) to automatically strip unprintable glyphs, emojis, music notes, and zero-width identifiers (e.g. `\u200b`). This prevents `FFmpeg` from crashing during the subtitle burn-in phase due to unsupported font fallbacks (`failed to find any fallback with glyph`).

---

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **YouTube DLP Subtitles**: Added the `--use-dlp-subs` flag to prioritize parsing YouTube's built-in manual and auto-generated `json3` subtitles, completely bypassing `faster-whisper` and drastically speeding up the audio-transcription phase of the clipping pipeline.

---

## [v0.4.2] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Gemini Fallback Model**: Added robust automatic fallback mechanism to retry with a secondary AI model (`--gemini-fallback-model`) if the main Gemini content engine exhausts its retry limits.

---

## [v0.4.1] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **YOLOv8 GPU Face Tracking**: Integrated PyTorch-based YOLO tracking (via `ultralytics`) as a high-powered alternative for face cropping (`--face-detector yolo`). Features auto-downloading of models (`8n`, `8s`, `8m`, `8n_v2`, `9c`) from Hugging Face for dynamic GPU execution.

---

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Standalone YouTube Auto-Uploader**: Created a dedicated CLI (`run_upload.py`) with a `youtube_uploader` package for automated background uploading and scheduling without interrupting the rendering pipeline.

### Changed
- **Centralized Outputs Directory**: Refactored the engine (`config.py`, `studio.py`, `runner.py`) so all generated media, thumbnails, and manifests are now neatly sandboxed inside an `outputs/` folder.
- **MediaPipe Tracking Upgrade**: Upgraded the smart auto-framing AI from the basic short-range model to the more robust `BlazeFace (Full-Range)` model. This resolves face-loss issues on wide-shot inputs and podcast frames.
- **Typographic Sweet Spots**: Fine-tuned default subtitles margins and CSS scaling (adjustable in `config.py`).

### Removed
- Deprecated and removed the obsolete `v2-youtube-clipping.ipynb` legacy notebook.

---

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Modular CLI Architecture**: Completely refactored the project from a monolithic Jupyter Notebook into a clean, CLI-based Python project (`main.py` & `clipping/` package).
- **Dynamic Scaling & Font Pairing (Kinetic Typography)**: Specific core words within the running subtitles now scale dynamically for emphasis (e.g., "I eat *RICE*").
- **Contextual B-roll Injection**: The system now automatically fetches and splices contextual B-roll footage from Pexels based on relevant keywords spoken in the clip.
- **Multi-language Documentation**: Added `README.md` (English) and `README_ID.md` (Indonesian), complete with execution guides for Google Colab.
- **Environment Management**: Introduced `.env` support to securely manage API keys, removing hardcoded/Colab userdata from the core logic.

### Changed
- **Gemini Model**: Configured support for both `gemini-3-flash-preview` and `gemini-2.5-flash` via config parameters.
- **Dependencies**: Streamlined dependency management, supporting both `uv` package manager and standard `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml`.

---

## [Planned / Upcoming Features]

- **[Planned] Wefluence Integration**: Building an automated batch clipping system that pulls source videos directly from Google Drive and YouTube, crafting compelling video compilations.
- **[Done → v0.7.0] Auto Camera Switch (Full 9:16)**: Implemented as `--camera-switch` flag with blurred pillarbox for simultaneous speech.
- **[Planned] 16:9 Speaker Switch**: Automatic Active Speaker detection for 16:9 that performs full frame cuts/switches (Speaker A / Speaker B / Wide Shot).
